# SCEgapfilled-framework

A simple machine learning-based gap-filling framework was developed for fine-scale snow cover mapping in monsoonal mountainous regions.

To use this code, you must first register for a free account on Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/).

For cloud-contaminated optical imagery, please use SCEgapfilled.js, while SCEclearsky.js is recommended for clear-sky conditions.

The code generates a binary snow cover map, which can be used to analyze snow cover extent dynamics. The proposed method has demonstrated robust reconstruction performance in cloud-prone, monsoon-influenced mountainous regions, significantly improving mapping accuracy under challenging atmospheric conditions.

SCE+[YYYY] denotes the collection of binary snow cover maps for the corresponding year.
